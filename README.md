## Thought behind the project

- During lockdown we lost touch with our friends. This project will help to mitigate loneliness and depression.

- This Project helps to connect people to each other even if they are at different locations.

## Further Improvements
- We are planing to integrate a real-time video chat with help of **Web-RTC**

- We will implement **Streaming through local file** feature.
